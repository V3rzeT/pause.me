# Pause Me
Pause Me helps you to apply the [20-20-20 rule](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eyestrain/basics/prevention/con-20032649) rule to prevent eyestrain while working in front of a screen.

It is a small Windows .NET application that hides in the taskbar. Every 20 minutes a pause overlay will be displayed on top of your currently running applications. The overlay shows a countdown timer and will hide itself as soon as the 20 seconds have passed.

In case you would like to skip a pause you can hide the overlay by pressing H (you can change it in the settings of the program, in Program.cs).
